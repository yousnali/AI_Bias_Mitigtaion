# AI_Bias_Mitigtaion
For this study an integrated and iterative approach for bias mitigation is proposed

COMPAS_Data preparation and exploration:
In this code the data is prepared, cleansed and explored

Distribution_graphs:
Distributions of relevant variables are generated by this code

Multi-colinearity_elimination:
Variables that are strongly correlated are removed here to eliminate possible multi-collinearity issues

COMPAS_Cross_Validation:
A logistic regression model is developed and cross validated using multiple methods

COMPAS_Debias_AIF360:
The model is debiased using the AIF360 library and revalidated

COMPAS dataset retrieved from: https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/compass?select=cox-violent-parsed.csv

The COMPAS dataset contains data of over 10,000 criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida, in the United States. Of these defendants, 18,316 observations are included in the dataset. This dataset contains a track record of the criminal history of defendants and outcomes of a predicted risk score generated by COMPAS spanning over a period of two years.
